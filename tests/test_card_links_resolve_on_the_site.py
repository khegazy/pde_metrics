"""A card's links must resolve both in the repository and on the documentation site.

A card is read in two places and is the same bytes in both: a colleague browsing the
repository on GitHub, and a reader on the generated site. Only some paths work in both.
`docs/gen_pages.py` rewrites card-to-card links, and `_generated/` assets are copied
alongside the page -- but a relative link to anything the site does not publish resolves
on GitHub and 404s on the site, which `mkdocs --strict` treats as a build failure.

`issues/` is the case that bites: it is deliberately not part of the site, so a card that
links to an issue by relative path breaks the build. Such a link has to be absolute.
