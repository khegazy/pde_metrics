"""Failure-mode tests: what the harness does when a run leaves the well-trodden path.

Every test here was written after reproducing the behaviour it describes, either on the
real 256^2 trajectory or through the real pipeline on synthetic frames. Each one asks the
same question the rest of the suite asks -- *does a wrong number look wrong?* -- but on
inputs the existing tests do not reach: a metric that is invariant to the operator the
D = 1 anchor is built from, a metric that improves as damage rises, an analysis grid that
the configured ladder does not fit on.

**Several of these are marked ``xfail(strict=True)``.** They describe defects that are
reproduced and written up in ``issues/``, not aspirations. Strict is deliberate: when
someone fixes the underlying problem the test starts passing, strict mode turns that into
a failure, and the fixer is forced to come here and remove the marker. Each marker names
the issue file carrying the measurement.

The tests themselves assert the *property*, never the current number, so they survive a
fix that changes magnitudes.

    documenting: the error names the operator but not the knob that caused it, and it is
    raised inside the frame loop, so the I/O for a long trajectory is paid before the run

    """The degenerate-severity level detector must cover uncalibrated operators too.

    Issue 030's calibration work added ``severity_degenerate``: a severity level that resolves to a
    severity at which the operator does nothing, or that repeats a milder severity level's
    experiment, is flagged in the result frame and dropped by ``summarise_axes`` before any
    acceptance statistic is computed. Scoring such a severity level would read as agreement in the
    rank correlation and would compare a distribution against itself in the separability.

    That work was driven by the *calibrated* spectral and smoothing axes. This checks the
    same guarantee on an axis whose severities stay absolute cell counts by design, where
    the no-op arises from the analysis grid rather than from the field's spectrum:
    ``translate_x`` runs to 16 cells in the shipped ladder, and on a periodic 16-cell axis
    ``np.roll(x, 16)`` is exactly ``x``. ``analysis_grid.resolution`` is a documented knob,
    so this configuration is reachable without editing the ladder at all.

    Measured here: level 5 records ``value = 0.0`` and ``energy_changed = 0.0``, is flagged,
    and is logged as "resolve[d] to a severity at which the operator leaves the field
    unchanged". Levels 1-4 are untouched. The detector is measurement-based rather than
    operator-declared, which is why it generalises to an operator that knows nothing about
    calibration -- and that generality is the thing worth pinning.
