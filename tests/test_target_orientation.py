"""Ordering statistics for a metric whose best value is not zero.

Every one-sided statistic in :mod:`fmeval.analysis` -- monotonicity, the adjacent-severity
AUC, the sensitivity and saturation thresholds, the rank correlation -- assumes damage
moves the value in one direction. That assumption fails for the spread-to-skill ratio,
which is calibrated at one and wrong on both sides of it: an ensemble that hedges reads
high, one that is overconfident reads low, and both are worse than the middle.

The repository adapts rather than the metric. ``spread_skill`` reports the raw ratio, as
the forecasting literature does, and declares ``target=1.0``; the analysis orders by
distance from that target. What is *reported* stays the ratio -- a reader still sees 0.4
and knows the ensemble is too narrow -- while what is *ranked* is how far from calibrated
it is.

Without this, a perfectly behaved calibration axis arrives in the report card flagged on
three criteria at once, and the flag says the metric is broken when the analysis is.
