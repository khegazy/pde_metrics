"""The card contract: what every bundle must carry, and what a bad card must say.

Two kinds of test live here. The first checks the schema and the prose rules against
hand-built examples, so a change to the rules shows up as a specific failure rather than
as twenty bundles going red at once. The second is parametrized over every bundle on
disk, so a real bundle that drifts out of contract names itself.

The parametrized tests pass vacuously while no bundles exist yet. That is intended: the
card system lands before the bundles move, so the move can be verified one bundle at a
time.
