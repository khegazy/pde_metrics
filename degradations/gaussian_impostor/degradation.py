    """IN-4: a spectrum-matched Gaussian random field.

    Keeps ``|X_k|`` exactly -- hence the energy spectrum, the two-point correlation, and
    every isotropic spectral diagnostic -- and replaces the phases with those of a white
    Gaussian field. The result has the right spectrum and no phase coupling: on this data
    its flatness is 3.01 against the reference's 17.06. It is not turbulence, and any
    metric that scores it near the reference is phase-blind and must not be used alone.

    **The gotcha this implementation exists to avoid:** take the phases from ``rfftn`` of a
    *real* Gaussian field rather than drawing ``exp(i U(0, 2pi))`` directly. Hand-drawn
    phases violate Hermitian symmetry at the self-conjugate modes (k=0, the Nyquist
    row/column, and the Nyquist corners), so ``irfftn`` silently discards imaginary parts
    and corrupts the very amplitude spectrum you were preserving. A first attempt that way
    produced flatness 47.9 instead of 3. Deriving the phase from a real field gets all the
    symmetry constraints right for free.

    ``ordinal=False``: this is excluded from every Spearman computation. Folding it into a
    family as "level 6" would silently corrupt every rank correlation it touched.

    **Which metrics this actually catches.** Not L2. Measured on the real vorticity field,
    MSE scores the impostor at 0.976 of chance -- it rejects it firmly, because a
    phase-randomised field is pointwise uncorrelated with the original. The canary is aimed
    at metrics that see only second-order statistics: an energy spectrum (BD-1) or a
    two-point correlation (BD-2) scores the impostor *perfectly*, since those are exactly
    what it preserves. Read the canary column alongside the displacement column: L2 passes
    the canary and fails on displacement, and a spectral metric does the reverse.
