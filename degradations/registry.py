"""Registry of degradation operators.

Same shape and same discovery mechanism as the metric registry, so adding a degradation is
one decorated function in one file::

    @degradation(family="smoothing", severity_name="sigma", severity_units="cells")
    def gaussian_blur(x, severity, *, ctx):
        '''Isotropic Gaussian kernel smoothing, periodic wrap.'''
        return gaussian_filter(x, sigma=severity, mode="wrap", axes=ctx.spatial_axes)

**Operators act on one field at a time**, ``(C, *spatial) -> (C, *spatial)``. That keeps
almost every operator a two-line pure array function. The ladder builder applies the
operator to each requested field with an RNG derived from
``(seed, label, frame_index, field)``, so deterministic operators stay automatically
consistent across fields while stochastic ones get independent draws. An operator that
genuinely needs cross-field access declares ``whole_frame=True``.

Two pieces of metadata exist to stop silent corruption of every Spearman downstream:

``severity_direction``
    Whether damage rises or falls with the severity value. The builder sorts each severity
    list into increasing-damage order, so a low-pass cutoff list written ``[64, 32, 16, 8]``
    gets the right ordinal levels instead of a perfectly inverted ladder.

``ordinal``
    Whether the operator lies on a monotone axis at all. The IN-4 impostor does not; it is
    a pass/fail canary, and folding it in as "level 6" of some family would corrupt every
    rank correlation it touched.

A third, ``preserves``, is a fact rather than a safeguard: what the operator provably leaves
unchanged, measured by a contract test exactly as ``severity_direction`` is. It lets a report
say, beside a measured response, what that degradation left intact.

#: ``"energy_above"`` / ``"energy_below"`` -- the severity is the fraction of the field's
#: fluctuation energy the operator destroys, resolved to a cutoff wavenumber against the
#: measured spectrum. The two differ by which side of the cutoff is removed: a low-pass removes
#: what lies *above* it, a high-pass what lies *below*. Declaring the wrong one silently
#: inverts the axis, which is why it is the operator's business to say and not the ladder's to
#: guess: with the sides swapped, "remove 5% of the energy" resolves to the wavenumber holding
#: 5% of it and removes 95% instead.
#: ``"scale"`` -- the severity is a fraction of the field's characteristic scale, resolved to a
#: length in cells.
#:
#: Absolute units are right where the number is already field-independent (a coarsening factor,
#: a displacement in cells) or already relative to something measured (noise as a fraction of
#: the fluctuation RMS). They are wrong for a wavenumber or a smoothing width, because those
#: land in completely different places depending on where the field keeps its energy.
