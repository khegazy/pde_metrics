    Removes the energy-containing large scales. Not a realistic surrogate failure, but a
    direct test of whether a metric registers large-scale structure at all.

    **The k=0 mode is preserved deliberately.** Deleting it removes the spatial mean, which
    for a field like density (1.0 with fluctuations of 2e-4) is a change four orders of
    magnitude larger than anything the cutoff controls. Measured before this was fixed:
    every severity level gave an identical damage of 2.7e7 relative to the unrelated-field level, so
    the axis carried no ordering at all and its rank correlation collapsed to 0.10. Keeping
    the mean makes the operator measure what it is named for -- removal of large-scale
    structure -- and restores a monotone ladder on every field.
