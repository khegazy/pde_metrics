## Definition

For fields $f$ (reference) and $g$ (candidate) on the same analysis grid, write
$\bar{f}$ for the spatial mean of the reference and $f' = f - \bar{f}$ for its
fluctuation. Then

$$
\mathrm{NRMSE}(f, g) = \frac{\mathrm{RMSE}(f, g)}
{\sqrt{\langle f'^2 \rangle}} \tag{1}
$$

where the average runs over channels and cells. The denominator is the root-mean-square
*fluctuation* of the reference, not its raw root-mean-square.

That choice is not cosmetic. The kinet weakly compressible density field is $1.0 \pm 1.8
\times 10^{-4}$, so its raw RMS is essentially one; dividing by that would leave the value
indistinguishable from RMSE and would hide four orders of magnitude of relative error,
making density and velocity incomparable on the same degradation. Removing the mean first
is what puts them on one scale.

The reference alone sets the denominator, so Equation (1) is not symmetric: exchanging the
two fields changes the value. Where the reference is spatially uniform there is no
fluctuation scale to divide by, and the metric returns NaN rather than an exception or an
infinity.

### Boundary handling

None. The operation is local to each cell, and the spatial mean is taken over the whole
field, so no neighbourhood and no boundary condition enter.

One row per family of degradation and physical field. **Rank correlation** asks whether the metric put the strengths of one degradation in the right order: it is the Spearman correlation between the metric and the applied strength, computed inside a single frame, and the column gives the range over the degradations in that family. A value of 1 means every strength was ordered correctly in every frame. **Weakest gap between neighbouring strengths** asks whether the metric can tell one strength from the next: it is the smallest Mann-Whitney overlap between any two neighbouring strengths, where 1 means the two never overlap and 0.5 means the metric cannot separate them at all. **First strength detected** is the mildest strength at which the metric has moved a tenth of the way from the undegraded reference toward a field with no relation to the truth; a dash means the metric never reached that tenth. **Damage** is that same 0-to-1 scale read as a number: 0 is the undegraded reference and 1 is an unrelated field.

This table reports what was measured and grades none of the measurements. What the numbers mean for this metric is written in the subsections below, beside the test that produced each number.

## Intuition

Normalised root mean squared error is the root mean squared error expressed as a fraction
of how much the reference field actually varies. An error of one unit means something
quite different in a field that swings by a thousand and in one that swings by two, and
dividing by the size of the reference's own variation is what makes those two situations
produce the same number.

The variation used is the fluctuation about the spatial mean, not the raw size of the
field. This matters more than the phrase suggests. A density field sitting at one with
ripples of a ten-thousandth would, if divided by its raw size, report a tiny error no
matter how badly the ripples were predicted, because the constant background would swamp
everything. Subtracting the mean first means the ripples are compared against the ripples.

Here is the whole point on a four-by-four grid. The same displaced feature is scored
twice: once as it stands, and once with both fields multiplied by a ten-thousandth, as a
density fluctuation riding on a background of one might be.

```
                          rmse      nrmse
as it stands              0.5       1.155
both fields x 0.0001      0.00005   1.155
```

The unnormalised score falls by four orders of magnitude and says nothing about whether
the prediction got worse. The normalised one does not move, because the error and the
reference's variation shrank together.

The consequence is that this is the one cell-by-cell baseline whose value can be read
across fields: a value of 0.1 means the error is a tenth of the field's variation, whether
the field is density, velocity or vorticity. It also means the reference and the candidate
are not interchangeable, since only the reference sets the scale.

What this metric ignores is the same thing every cell-by-cell metric ignores: where the
errors sit.

## Reading the output

The value runs from zero upwards with no upper limit and is dimensionless. Lower is
better, and zero means the fields are identical. One is a useful landmark rather than a
bound: it means the error is as large as the reference's own fluctuation, which is roughly
what predicting the mean everywhere would achieve.

Because it is dimensionless, this is the cell-by-cell baseline that supports the
comparison the others cannot: across fields, and across datasets whose fields have
different magnitudes. Comparisons across models on one field are of course still valid.

Two cautions. It is asymmetric, so the reference must genuinely be the reference. And it
is undefined for a spatially uniform reference, where it returns NaN — a run reporting NaN
here is reporting that the field had no fluctuation to normalise against, not that
something failed.

## Limitations

The normalisation hides absolute magnitude, which is occasionally the thing you needed to
know. Two models with the same NRMSE on fields whose fluctuations differ by three orders
of magnitude have wildly different absolute errors, and if the downstream use is sensitive
to absolute error the number will not warn you.

The denominator is measured from the reference on each frame, so as the flow decays and
its fluctuation shrinks, the same absolute error produces a growing NRMSE. That is
usually the desired behaviour, but it means a rising NRMSE along a trajectory does not by
itself indicate a worsening prediction.

Being a positive rescaling of RMSE, it orders candidates on a single field exactly as MSE
and RMSE do, and inherits their blindness to position and their quadratic response to
sub-cell displacement.

Both coarsenings are ordered correctly on every field, with a rank correlation of 1. They differ in size. At a factor of 16, `coarsen` costs 0.19, 0.10 and 0.43 of the unrelated-field value on density, velocity and vorticity, and `coarsen_bandlimited` 0.04, 0.03 and 0.38. The two operators keep the same block means, so on the smooth fields most of what `coarsen` charges is its staircase; on vorticity, whose structure the coarse grid genuinely cannot hold, they nearly agree. Under the band-limited operator density is in the right order in only 71% of frames: its damage at factors 2 and 4 is 0.001 and 0.002, and which of the two is larger changes from frame to frame. The other pointwise metrics, `spectrum_l2` and `h1_seminorm` show this on density too, and its
cause is not established; `issues/039` records what was ruled out.

| vorticity | 0.945 | `translate_x=16` | 1.5 |

The fake prediction here has exactly the reference field's amplitude spectrum and completely scrambled structure. Damage of 1 is what a field with no relation to the truth scores, so the damage column says how close to useless this metric considers that fake prediction: a low number means the metric was fooled. The third column translates the same number into an ordinary degradation whose damage the fake prediction matches, which is easier to picture.

### Compared with the other metrics

| `kinetic_energy` | -0.284 |

Computed on the median value at each combination of degradation and strength, over every degradation and physical field in the run, with the undegraded reference excluded. Two metrics correlating near 1 put the degradations in the same order, but the two may still weight those degradations very differently. A correlation near 1 therefore means the two metrics are redundant for ranking models, not that the two are interchangeable as training losses.

<!-- END GENERATED results_summary -->

NRMSE correlates with MSE at 0.974 and with MAE at 0.963 across every degradation, above
the 0.95 redundancy threshold. Its distinct contribution is not a different ordering but a
comparable scale: it is the one baseline that allows a density result and a vorticity result to
be read side by side.
