"""Registry of metric functions.

A metric is an ordinary function decorated with :func:`metric`. The decorator records
metadata and returns the function *unwrapped*, so metrics stay directly importable and
testable without the harness and carry no per-call indirection.

Three arities are supported:

* ``arity="pairwise"`` -- ``fn(reference, candidate)``, both ``(C, *spatial)``
* ``arity="single"``   -- ``fn(x)``, ``(C, *spatial)``
* ``arity="ensemble"`` -- ``fn(reference, members)``, ``(C, *spatial)`` and
  ``(N, C, *spatial)``: one reference realization and the ensemble standing in for a
  predictive distribution over it. Same positional count as ``pairwise``, so the arity
  rather than the signature is what distinguishes them.

Most metrics are best at zero. A metric whose best value is elsewhere -- the spread-to-
skill ratio, which is calibrated at one and wrong in both directions -- declares
``target=``, and the analysis layer orients its ordering statistics by distance from that
target instead of assuming monotone damage. The metric keeps reporting the quantity the
literature reports.

If a function additionally declares a keyword-only parameter named ``ctx``, the pipeline
passes a :class:`~fmeval.context.MetricContext` carrying grid spacing, periodicity, the
field name and the physical time. Detection happens once, here, via :mod:`inspect`, so the
common case needs no boilerplate.

Some metrics are *pointwise-decomposable*: their scalar value is a reduction of a per-cell
density. Declare the companion map with :func:`pointwise_map` and the reduction with the
``reduction=`` argument; the contract test then verifies ``R(map(a, b)) == metric(a, b)``.
