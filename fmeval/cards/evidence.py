"""Turn one evaluation run into the measured half of every metric card.

Consumes a run folder rather than running the pipeline itself. The evaluation is
expensive and happens where the data lives; generating documentation from its output is
cheap and should not require repeating it. That separation also means a card's numbers
can always be traced to a named run rather than to whenever someone last regenerated.

Nothing here computes a statistic of its own. Every number comes from
:mod:`fmeval.analysis`, which is the same code the LaTeX report uses, so a card and a
