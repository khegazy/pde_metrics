"""Checks on ``card.md``: the sections that must exist and what must be in them.

The prose half of a card is written for three readers at once, and the sections exist to
stop any one of them being forgotten:

* an **early graduate student in any STEM field**, who should finish ``## Intuition``
  knowing why the test matters and what its number means, without a background in fluids
  or ML -- and without being walked through it: state the idea directly, keep any example
  compact, and trust the reader with everything except the jargon;
* a **domain expert**, who needs the definition, the discretisation and the failure modes;
* a **coding agent**, which needs the structure to be predictable enough that it never has
  to guess where something is.

Only the mechanical parts are checked here. Whether the prose is *good* is a human's
judgement, recorded through the review ledger in :mod:`fmeval.cards.review`.

On judging whether a section says enough
---------------------------------------
There are no word counts here, and that is deliberate. A count is a proxy that measures
length rather than clarity, and an author told to reach ninety words reaches ninety words,
so the check would manufacture exactly the padding it was meant to prevent.

What is checked instead is structural and mechanical: that the section exists, is not
empty, holds no sentinel, keeps notation out of the sections written for readers from
outside the field, and -- in the results -- that measurements come from the generator and
are linked to the tests that produced them. What each section has to *say* is described in
the templates, in words, so an author is told what is wanted rather than how long to make
it. Whether it succeeds is a human's judgement, recorded through the review ledger in
:mod:`fmeval.cards.review`, which cannot be signed until measurements exist to back the
claims.

The order moves from what the metric *is* to what it *did here*. ``Definition`` opens,
because the equation is the thing being documented and everything after it is commentary
on that equation. ``Intuition`` then says the same thing in words, and ``Reading the
output`` and ``Limitations`` complete the account of the metric itself -- how to
interpret a value, and where a value misleads. Only then does the card turn to this
repository's measurements: ``Performance`` and ``Results`` are generated, and the prose
beside them reads what was measured.

The split matters for reuse. A reader adopting this metric in another project needs the
first four sections and nothing else; they hold for any dataset. The last two are
findings about the canonical run and change when it does.

``Results`` is deliberately not called "Verdict". A verdict invites a yes or a no, and no
metric here earns one: the useful thing to record is what this metric sees, what this
metric misses, and how this metric compares to the baseline controls, so a reader can
decide whether it fits the question they are asking.

field, and a reader comparing results across projects has no way to tell which was used
unless it is written down.

"None" is a perfectly good answer and the common one for pointwise metrics -- but it has
to be said, with the reason, rather than left to be inferred from silence. An empty

physical field -- how reliably the metric ordered the severities, how well neighbouring
severities separated, how much damage the metric reported, and how the metric scored the
trap tests -- and the section carries no prose at all.

No prose because there is nothing here a person could add that would not be either a
number they typed by hand, which nothing checks, or a judgement about whether those
numbers are good, which this repository does not make. The reading of the numbers belongs
in ``## Results``, beside the test that produced each one.

all of it at once. Splitting them that way meant a reader comparing a claim to the number
behind that claim had to scroll between two places and work out which figure the sentence
was about, and it invited an assessment that summarised the whole degradation ladder in
general rather than saying what each test found.
