# Refreshing the evidence

Every measured number on every page traces back to one pinned evaluation run. Replacing
that run — after adding a metric or a degradation, changing which strengths are applied,
or adding a dataset — is routine work, but the order of the steps matters and one step is
easy to miss.

## 1. Produce the run

On a machine with the data:

```bash
python evaluate.py 'metrics=[mae,mse,rmse,nrmse,enstrophy,kinetic_energy]' \
    dataset=kinet_re5e4 dataset.time.start=2000 dataset.time.reduction=50
```

Use the time window recorded in `configs/cards/default.yaml`, adding any newly implemented
metrics to the list. Note the name of the `results/comparison_<stamp>` folder the run
writes.

## 2. Regenerate in dependency order

```bash
python -m fmeval.cards exemplars --all                              # if operators or the
                                                                    # canonical frame changed
python -m fmeval.cards evidence --all --results results/comparison_<stamp>
python -m fmeval.cards overview --results results/comparison_<stamp>  # docs/figures/<run>/
python -m fmeval.cards catalog
```

Example panels come before measurements, because a metric's measurements may reference a
degradation's panel. The `evidence` step also redraws each card's figures (the sensitivity
profile and the response curves) into `_generated/` as SVG with the numbers behind each in
a JSON file of the same name, so a figure cannot go stale relative to the table beside it.
`--all` skips any card whose metric the run does not contain and says so; the four
probabilistic metrics are pinned to their own single-metric runs on `synthetic_ensemble`
and are regenerated one at a time from those folders. Run from the repository root with a
relative `--results` path, because the path is written into every block marker as typed.
The `overview` step draws the cross-metric figures of the site's "Sensitivity at a glance"
page into `docs/figures/<run>/`; delete the previous run's directory there when you replace
the run, so the page shows one run. The catalog comes last, because it reads the fingerprint
files the other steps write. The committed catalog is compared against a freshly built one in
CI, so forgetting that last step fails the build rather than shipping a stale index.

## 3. The step that is easy to miss: the prose

Generated blocks update themselves. **Numbers that an author typed into sentences do
not.** The Results readings on each page cite specific values — ratios, correlations,
damage scores — from the previous run, and nothing mechanical reconciles them yet.
`issues/032` proposes that check; until it exists, reconciling them is a manual
obligation.

For every metric, compare each number in the hand-written Results text against the
regenerated tables beside it, and either correct the sentence or flag it. This has caused
real trouble before: the first pages carried damage scores of 0.80 and 0.51 for the fake
prediction, taken from a 15-snapshot run, while the reference run measured 0.90, 0.66 and
1.23. If you are an agent, list every number you changed in your report — that list is
exactly what a reviewer needs in order to re-check the work.

## 4. Signatures invalidate themselves — tell the humans

Editing prose changes the page's hash, so any signed page you corrected becomes unsigned.
That is correct behaviour: the signature attested to text that no longer exists.
Regenerating the blocks alone does **not** invalidate a signature, because generated
content is stripped out before hashing — which means a page whose tables changed but whose
prose still describes the old run keeps its signature while being wrong. That is the gap
`issues/032` describes. Until it closes, name in your report every signed page whose
tables materially changed, so that its owner can reread and re-sign.

## 5. Finish

```bash
python -m fmeval.cards check --all
pytest
```

Commit the reference to the new run folder, the regenerated `_generated/` content, the
catalog and the prose corrections together, so that the repository never holds a mixture
of numbers from two different runs.
