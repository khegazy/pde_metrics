"""Build the site's pages from the bundles, at docs build time.

Cards are read where they live rather than copied into ``docs/``. A colleague browsing the
repository and a reader on the site see the same bytes, and there is no second copy to
drift.

Three kinds of page are produced here:

* one page per bundle, its card wrapped in a header table drawn from the typed record and
  followed by the module's API;
* the indexes -- a filterable catalogue, the degradation gallery, the navigation tree;
* the machine surfaces, ``catalog.json`` and ``llms.txt``.

Links inside cards are written to work on GitHub, as ``../../degradations/<name>/card.md``.
They are rewritten here for the site's flatter layout, which is the one place the two
readers genuinely need different text.
